# ASRL Robotics Project 
   - Summer 2018
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Inspiration and Goal
   In order to properly model the natural world around us, we create accurate simulations and models. One area that our lab believes is      important to understand is the modeling of orbital mechanics. Computer simulations can create fantastic models, however, there can be a large mental hurdle in seeing and understanding a three dimensional space recreated on a two dimensional screen. This lack of complete visualization inspired the creation of this vehicle. 
   
   The goal of this project is to create a mobile ground vehicle coupled with a 6 degree of freedom robotic arm in order to accurately model the orbital mechanics of a spacecraft as it moves in space. The end effector of the robotic arm has a small model spacecraft/cubesat that will allow the observer to see the paths and manuevers that the model is recreating. We can also use the GPS camera system built in our lab to visualize on the computer the maneuvers that the hardware just preformed. One important aspect of this vehicle is the portability of the simulator. There are many similar machines that have the same goal of emulating this movement, but these are large mechanisms that cannot easily transfer from room to room.

## Applications
This spacecraft simulation has applications in both education and defense.

#### Defense
   The simulations and tests of this robot can determine if an object in low Earth orbit (LEO) or geostationary earth orbit (GEO) is free floating, or is being controlled.

#### Education
   The tests and simulations preformed using this robotic vehicle can be used to visualize various amounts of manuevers that a spacecraft can preform. For example, by utilizing two of these vehicles you can model docking manuevers between two seperate spacecraft and view the reactions of contact in space in real time.
