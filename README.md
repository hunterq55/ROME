# ASRL Robotics Project
   - Summer 2018
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Inspiration and Goal
   In order to properly model the natural world around us, we create accurate simulations and models. One area that our lab believes is      important to understand is the modeling of orbital mechanics. Computer simulations can create fantastic models, however, there can be a large mental hurdle in seeing and understanding a three dimensional space recreated on a two dimensional screen. This lack of complete visualization inspired the creation of this vehicle. 
   
   The goal of this project is to create a mobile ground vehicle that utilized a 6 degree of freedom robotic arm in order to accurately model the orbital mechanics of a spacecraft as it dances in space. The end effector of the robotic arm has a small model spacecraft/cubesat which by utilizing feedback from a radar system within our lab, we can visualize on the computer the maneuvers that the hardware just preformed.


## Applications
This spacecraft simulation has applications in both education and defense.

#### Defense
   The simulations and tests of this robot can determine if an object in low Earth orbit (LEO) or geostationary earth orbit (GEO) is free floating, or is being controlled.

#### Education
   The tests and simulations
